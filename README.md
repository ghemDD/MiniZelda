## Synopsis

The Dark Lord decided to take control of the village, and placed monsters all over the place, we set out to stop him in his tracks and to free the castle from his evil reign.

### Fighting the Dark Lord
The Dark Lord is immune to all physical and fire type attacks, he is however vulnerable to magic type attacks. To beat him, the staff must be acquired from the temple that is located to the right of the area "Route", to access this area, the orb must be activated by shooting it with a bow.

If you lose all your hp during battle, you won't be able to move but simply press "R" to resume the game and recover all your hp.

#### Dark Lord's powers  
* Flame Skull monsters

Inside should be the staff, a chest containing an APE_FLOWER that allows the player to transform into the dark state (a state where the monsters do not recognize him, but cannot attack once in this state), and a portal that leads to the area "RouteChateau" where the Dark Lord is located.
