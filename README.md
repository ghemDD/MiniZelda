## Synopsis

The Dark Lord decided to take control of the VIIIage, and placed monsters all over the place, our hero and his loyal companion set out to stop him in his tracks and to free the castle from his evil reign.

### Village
The village is the central hub of the map. You can interact with different types of characters whose reactions depend on your reputation.  
You can also decide to go shopping and buy the following items : 
* a bow and arrows, to fight the log monsters et flaming skulls
* a bomb, to potentially destroy natural elements obstructing the way
* a magical staff, once you have discovered it  

Coins are a guaranteed Log Monster drop, and are sometimes randomly dropped once grass has been cut or bombed.

### Fighting the Dark Lord
The Dark Lord is immune to all physical and fire type attacks, he is however vulnerable to magic type attacks. To beat him, the staff must be acquired from the temple that is located to the right of the area "Route", to access this area, the orb must be activated by shooting it with a bow.
